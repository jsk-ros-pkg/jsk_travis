More details about Python 2 support in pip can be found at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/release-process/#python-2-support pip 21.0 will remove support for this functionality.

  Hi there!
  The URL you are using to fetch this script has changed, and this one will no
  longer work. Please use get-pip.py from the following URL instead:
  https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py
  Sorry if this change causes any inconvenience for you!
  We don't have a good mechanism to make more gradual changes here, and this
  renaming is a part of an effort to make it easier to us to update these
  scripts, when there's a pip release. It's also essential for improving how we
  handle the `get-pip.py` scripts, when pip drops support for a Python minor
  version.
  There are no more renames/URL changes planned, and we don't expect that a need
  would arise to do this again in the near future.
  Thanks for understanding!
  - Pradyun, on behalf of the volunteers who maintain pip.
